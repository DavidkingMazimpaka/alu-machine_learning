# Convolutions and Pooling

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, the following concepts:

### General

- **Convolution:** Understanding the process of convolution in image processing and its role in feature extraction.
- **Max Pooling and Average Pooling:** Explaining the purpose and functioning of max pooling and average pooling in neural networks.
- **Kernel/Filter:** Defining what a kernel or filter is and how it is applied during convolution.
- **Padding:** Understanding the concept of padding and its types, such as "same" padding and "valid" padding.
- **Stride:** Explaining the concept of stride and its role in determining the step size of the convolution operation.
- **Channels:** Understanding the concept of channels in images and their significance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **Performing Convolution:** Demonstrating how to perform convolution over an image using kernels.
- **Performing Max/Average Pooling:** Illustrating the process of max and average pooling over an image and their effects on feature maps.
