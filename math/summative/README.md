# Linear Regression Summative

## Overview

1. This Python script performs linear regression analysis model using gradient descent on a given a data set that will create a model that predicts TV sales. It utilizes the ordinary least squares (OLS) method to estimate the parameters of the linear regression model.
2. This shows the creation of decision trees and random Forests models compare the Root Mean Squared Errors to the Linear regression model, and rank the models them accordingly

## Usage for Decision Trees and Random Forests

1. **Decision Trees:** To create a decision tree model, use the following command:

2. **Random Forests:** To create a random forests model, use the following command:

3. **Comparing Models:** After running the scripts for linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, compare the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) of the models. Lower RMSE indicates better performance. Rank the models accordingly based on their RMSE values.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script with a sample dataset:

1. a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. You will investigate three different approaches to this problem. You will use NumPy and Scikit-Learn linear regression models, as well as construct and optimize the sum of squares cost function with gradient descent from scratch.
